# Enso

Enso is typescript framework built with a thin compatibility layer
that provides developers a rich framework for building server side applications.

Enso seeks to create a balanced community that is informed by both classical
and modern Software Architecture and programming principles.

## Getting Started

- Coming soon

## Community

Our aim is to have the majority of resources that may be developed - owned, operated and vetted by the community.

Reach out and help shape the development with us on [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/enso-ts/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/enso-ts/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

### Identity

Enso is experimenting with using the concept of using a `Verifable dispsable handle`.

More information on how to create one can be found here:

Apart from obvious Privacy issues. Open source projects now seem to suffer from
populism that has been attributed to the rise of personal branding over quality code.

Additionaly strategies such as `[Blind Reviews](https://blog.zgp.org/blind-code-reviews-experiment/)` have been created to address [gender bias](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/08/gender-bias-code-reviews/).
