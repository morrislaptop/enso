### Identity

Enso is experimenting with using the concept of using a `Verifable dispsable handle`.

More information on how to create one can be found here:

Apart from obvious Privacy issues. Open source projects now seem to suffer from
populism that has been attributed to the rise of personal branding over quality code.

Additionaly strategies such as `[Blind Reviews](https://blog.zgp.org/blind-code-reviews-experiment/)` have been created to address [gender bias](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/08/gender-bias-code-reviews/).
