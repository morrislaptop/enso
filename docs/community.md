# Community

Our approach should always be informed though research, observation, measurement balanced with a sense of pragmatism and flair.

## Conribution

Enso will be experimenting with building a `sustainable open source` community.

From a high level this means that contributors are rewarded according to the type of work they contribute.

Our aim is to have the majority of resources written, owned, operated and vetted by the community.

OSS is hard and needs new models of operation. Read more about it [here](https://github.blog/2019-01-17-lets-talk-about-open-source-sustainability/) and [here](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43zak3/the-internet-was-built-on-the-free-labor-of-open-source-developers-is-that-sustainable).

### Contribution ideas

- [Documendation](#docs) Contribute to improving the documentaion
- [Recipes](#recipies) Contibute by creating a "How to" Recipe
- [Tests](#test) Contibute by adding tests
- [EIPs](#test) Contibute by creating an EIP

### Measuring contibution

Having to mesaure contribution dictates that all work needs to be online. Thus we need to develop the relevant tooling and rethoric to frame the conversartion.

For example:

- How do we agree upon the value for a unit of work?
- Is sofware quality only measured by lines of code?
- How do we measure abstract units of work?
- Can we and â€” should we assign value though an algroithm? See: <https://medium.com/gitcoin/experiments-with-liberal-radicalism-ad68e02efd4>

Reach out and help shape the development of this idea on [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/enso-ts/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/enso-ts/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
